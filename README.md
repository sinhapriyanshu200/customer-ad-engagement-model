# 🎯 Customer Ad Click Prediction Using Classification Models

This project uses supervised machine learning models to predict whether a user will click on an online advertisement, based on their demographic and browsing behavior.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Given user-specific features like age, income, time spent on site, and internet usage, the goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a user will click on an ad or not.

## 🧠 Models Implemented

- ✅ **Logistic Regression**
- ✅ **Decision Tree**
- ✅ **Random Forest**

---

## 🔍 Key Features

- Cleaned and preprocessed advertising data from `advertising.csv`.
- Conducted detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** using seaborn and matplotlib:
  - Age distribution
  - Internet usage patterns
  - Joint plots between features
- Engineered features and handled categorical/numerical data appropriately.
- Trained classification models using `scikit-learn`.
- Evaluated models using:
  - **Accuracy**
  - **Precision**
  - **Recall**
  - **F1 Score**
  - **Confusion Matrix**

## 🏆 Model Comparison

| Metric               | Logistic Regression | Decision Tree | Random Forest |
|----------------------|---------------------|----------------|----------------|
| **Accuracy**         | 0.90                | 0.93           | **0.96**       |
| **Precision (Class 1)** | 0.96             | 0.94           | **0.97**       |
| **Recall (Class 1)**    | 0.84             | 0.93           | **0.95**       |
| **F1-Score (Class 1)**  | 0.89             | 0.93           | **0.96**       |

👉 **Random Forest** emerged as the best-performing model.
